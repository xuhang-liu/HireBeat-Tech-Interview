## Pre-interview Instructions

Thank you for taking the time to go through our interview process. We're happy to have you here! At any time before the interview please change the " " at the top of this file to your name and commit and push back to this repository. This way we know that you have all the appropriate access before we start your interview.

Please make sure `npm` is running on your computer, you should be able to run `npm install` and `npm run start` during the interview.

Run `npm install --global yarn`

During the interview we use the screensharing feature of Zoom. Please download their application ahead of time. The interviewer will switch presenter mode to you so you can share your screen.

## About the interview

The interview will cover some React and React project related tasks that you might encounter in day-to-day life. There are no trick questions and each of the challenges touches a slightly different aspect of React. You will have one hour to do the interview.

We would like to remind you that the goal of this interview is not to complete all tasks in the shortest amount of time possible. This interview really helps us understand your current skillset, your skill levels, and helps us determine what kind of training we can expect to help you with in the future.

When the session starts the interviewer will push code to this repository, you can then `git pull` everything in. You and the interviewer can take 15 minutes to perform an `npm install` make sure that things are working in your environment, and you can take a look at the code base and ask any questions and read the tasks before you start. You and your interviewer will mute the conversation, but if something gets you stuck or you feel like you need some help from the interviewer you can talk at any time. If the interviewer feels like you need a nudge in the right direction, they may start talking too, so make sure you would be able to hear the interviewer at all times.

We are not testing your memory, so during this interview you can access any resource you would like; feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, Github or anything else, at HireBeat we use them all the time. All tasks have more than one solution, and there is no wrong answer; if for example you know there is a better solution but it will take too much time or itâ€™s not worth trade off to implement, you are free to make an executive decision by choosing an easier solution. After the interview we will ask you to submit a form where you can leave any notes about the decisions you made, so if you made such executive decision, make sure to mention it!

The interviewer will let you know when the time is up and the interview is over. Please commit and push your code immediately, it is no issue if your code is not running at the time, so please don't try to fix anything after the time has run out.

We encourage you to work the way you would work for any other project. Below are IDE recommendations but feel free to use anything you want.

## IDE Recommendations

We recommend to use the latest version of Visual Studio Code with the following plugins:
 1. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components
 1. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tagName
 1. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight

-> `` COMMAND + ` `` or -> `` CTRL + ` `` opens a terminal in Visual Code. This could be useful to run `npm start` in and see any errors while developing

## What do you not have to worry about?
 - Fixing any npm audits or vulnerabilities
 - Fixing any configuration files such as webpack, lints, babel, jsconfig
 - Creating any tests
